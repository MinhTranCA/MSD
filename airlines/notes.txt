runme.m has several different options to run the multimodal alignment on the airlines dataset
the default run is set to 1/k weight with Bipartite Matching to resolve the matching
the user can pick which method to run

All multimodal alignment methods run in a few minutes so the user can create a for loop to run all methods

For the pairwise alignment (which takes much longer - order of hours), there are 3 methods that the user can pick from
option 1: bp - Solve the network alignment problem with Belief Propagation
option 2: mr - Compute the matching relaxation heuristic for network alignment
option 3: iso - Solve an overlap matching problem with IsoRank
