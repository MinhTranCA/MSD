notes:
run the script `runme.m`

To regenerate the data, you will need to rerun one or more of these three files:
(1) recovery_plot_pairwise
(2) recovery_plot_multimodal
(3) recovery_plot_pairwise_iso

More details can be found in final_plots.m (from which the following three lines have been taken)

mr = load('pairwise_recovery_mr'); %output form recovery_plot_pairwise
msd = load('multimodal_recovery'); %output from recovery_plot_multimodal
iso = load('pairwise_recovery_iso'); %output from recovery_plot_pairwise_iso
